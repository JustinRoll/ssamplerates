=1= Introduction

The intention of this program is to play sounds over a windows audio device at different specified sample rates.
--------------------
=2= Specifics

The UI will look as follows:

.File select button with a label displaying path/name of file.
.Next to this label will be another label listing the file's internal sample rate
.There will be a set of radio buttons to slow or speed up the sample rate by 0.8 intervals up and down (Ullillilia spec on his website)
.There will be one radio button for a specific sample rate set by the user from an input field (numerics only)
.A button to start, pause, and stop
.Global keyboard shortcuts so this can be played in the background without having to change window

Keyboard Shortcuts:

Ctrl+[  play
Ctrl+]  pause
Ctrl+\  stop
Ctrl+-  decrease speed
Ctrl++  increase speed

Ullillillia spec:


Supported decoders:
mp3
flac
wav


Future potential features:
hopefully webm/flv/mp4 support for youtubes
youtube streaming playback


Purpose of this software:
For education as well as to make fun sounds.  Sometimes, as Ulillillia has shown me, music sounds really good when slowed down or sped up through sample rates.
